#  Python Memory Management

In Python, memory management is handled automatically by the Python interpreter. When you create an object in Python, the interpreter assigns memory for the object and determines when that memory can be safely released.

To understand how this works, it's helpful to know about two key concepts in Python memory management: reference counting and garbage collection.

## Reference Counting

Reference counting is a technique for keeping track of the number of references to an object in memory. Each object has a reference count, which is incremented every time the object is referenced by another object. When an object's reference count reaches zero, the object is no longer being used and the memory it occupies can be released.

Here's a simple example of reference counting in action:

```py
>>> a = [1, 2, 3]  # Create a list object and assign it to the variable 'a'
>>> b = a  # Assign 'a' to another variable 'b'
>>> c = a  # Assign 'a' to another variable 'c'
>>> del a  # Delete the reference to 'a'
>>> del b  # Delete the reference to 'b'
>>> del c  # Delete the reference to 'c'
```

In this example, the list object `[1, 2, 3]` is initially referenced by the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. When the references to `a`, `b`, and `c` are deleted, the list object's reference count drops to zero, and the memory it occupies can be released.

## Garbage Collection

Although reference counting is effective for many purposes, it has some limitations. In particular, it can't handle circular references, where two objects refer to each other. To address this issue, Python also includes a garbage collector that periodically scans the heap (the area of memory where objects are stored) and frees any objects that are no longer being used.

Here's an example of a circular reference:

```py
>>> class Node:
...     def __init__(self, value):
...         self.value = value
...         self.next = None
...
>>> a = Node(1)  # Create a Node object and assign it to the variable 'a'
>>> b = Node(2)  # Create a Node object and assign it to the variable 'b'
>>> a.next = b  # Set 'a' to refer to 'b'
>>> b.next = a  # Set 'b' to refer to 'a'
>>> del a  # Delete the reference to 'a'
>>> del b  # Delete the reference to 'b'
```

In this example, the objects `a` and `b` refer to each other, so their reference counts never reach zero. If we rely on reference counting alone, the objects will never be eligible for garbage collection. To handle this situation, Python's garbage collector steps in and frees the objects once it determines that they are no longer being used.


Overall, Python's memory management system does a good job of freeing up memory when it is no longer needed, without requiring you to manually manage memory or worry about memory leaks. However, it's important to understand the basics of how it works, as it can be useful in understanding how your application is using memory and troubleshooting memory-related issues
